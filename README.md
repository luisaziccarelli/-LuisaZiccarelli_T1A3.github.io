# Luisa Ziccarelli's Portolio Website

As an assigment for my coding bootcamp @Coder Academy I was asked to build my first website. This website is a portfolio website, where you can find more information about me, my journey as new developer, projects I have been working on, and my interests. Here is a link to my porftolio website:

## My Portfolio Website
My portfolio website is meant to be a professional and creativ resource for other people to get to know me and my work. As a new devleoper I wanted my portfolio to be a professional resource to be able to showcase the skills I have learned so far in my journey as a developer, whilst also reflecting my personality and creativity. I drew from my main interests design, illustration, and art as sources of inspiration for this website.

## Functionality and features
My portfolio main features include:
    - **Main page**: this page features an illustration and an intro to my website.  
    - **About page**: here you will find more information about me, along with an animation I created using css. In this page you will be able to download a pdf version of my resume. 
    - **Blog page**: in this section of my website you will find a few different blogs I have written since I started my coding journey including: how I made a career change from psychology to coding, my top 5 tips on thriving and staying motivated during your bootcamp experience, and my experience building my first terminal app in ruby. 
    - **Contact page**: in this section will find a contact form that you can use to get in touch with me to provide any feedback or if you are interested in collaborating/working together. Also you will find links to my social media accounts so we can stay connected.

This portfolio is targeted to fellow developers, potential employers, and those new to the dev world who are looking to network and collaborate. 

## Tech stack (e.g. html, css, deployment platform, etc)
This website was built entirely using: HTML5, CSS3, and SAAS. I also used tools like Flexbox to make the website responsive.
