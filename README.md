# Portolio Website

This project is the third assingment of the Gentech Bootcamp @CoderAcademy and it consists in building my very own first website. This website is a portfolio website, aimed to share information about myself, my journey as new developer, projects I have been working on, and my interests to potential employers and other devs. Here is a link to my porftolio website: 

- URL: https://luisaziccarelli.github.io/-LuisaZiccarelli_T1A3.github.io/.
- Github repo: git@github.com:luisaziccarelli/-LuisaZiccarelli_T1A3.github.io.git

## My Portfolio Website
My portfolio website is meant to be a professional and creative resource for other people to get to know me and my work. As a new devleoper I wanted my portfolio to be both a professional resource that showcased the skills I have learned so far in my journey as a developer, but also fun and reflective of my personality and creativity. I drew from my main interests design, illustration, and art as sources of inspiration for this website.

## Functionality and features
My portfolio main features include:
    - **Main page**: this page features an illustration and an intro to my website and a welcome message. A simple desing was chosen given there were a few other elements such as color, fonts, and links drawing the user's attention.   
    - **About page**: this section includes information about myself personally and professionally. In this page the user is able to download a pdf version of my resume. I included an animation of a panda created using css. However this is not my creation and copyrights belong to Coding Artist (https://www.instagram.com/coding.artist).
    Here is the URL to the youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA3Y_kKkrD4
    - **Blog page**: in this section of my website there are a few different blogs I have written since I started my coding journey including: how I made a career change from psychology to coding, my top 5 tips on thriving and staying motivated during your bootcamp experience, and my experience building my first terminal app in ruby. 
    - **Contact page**: in this section there is a contact form that can be used to get in touch with me to provide any feedback or express interest in collaborating/working with me. Also in this section there are links to my social media accounts: linkedin, twitter, and github.
